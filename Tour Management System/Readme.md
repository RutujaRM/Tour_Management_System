# Backend  :- npm run start-dev
               http://localhost:4000

1) Main file :- app.js
2) npm init :- create package.json file
3) npm install :- To install all dependencies

## File Structure :- 
   #### controllers :- 
 To handle the application logic. They receive incoming requests from clients, process them by interacting with models and services, and 
 send back appropriate responses.
                                Contain methods (functions) that handle specific HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different endpoints.Perform business logic, data validation, and orchestrate interactions between models (data layer) and services (business logic layer).

  #### models :-
 It represent the data structure and interact directly with the database or data storage layer.
Define schemas or models that define the structure and constraints of data entities (e.g., User, Product) used in the application.
Provide methods (like CRUD operations) to interact with the database, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
  
  #### routes :- 
  Routes define the endpoints (URL paths) that clients can request and how the server should respond to those requests.
  Map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific controller methods that handle these requests.
  Provide a clear structure for API endpoints and their corresponding actions.
  
 #### utils :- 
 Utilities or helper functions that provide reusable functionalities across different parts of the application.
Contains functions that perform common tasks such as data validation, formatting, authentication, logging, etc.
Encapsulate logic that is not directly related to business logic or data manipulation but supports other parts of the application.



### Dependencies

  1) bcryptjs :- JavaScript library used for hashing passwords and comparing hashed passwords.To enhance security, particularly in user authentication systems.bcryptjs is a crucial library for securing passwords.It ensure that passwords are stored securely and can be verified efficiently, enhancing the security of your applicationâ€™s authentication system.  

   ##### Generating Salts:  genSaltSync, genSalt
Generating salts involves creating a random sequence of bytes to add complexity and uniqueness to hashed passwords. This cryptographic technique mitigates vulnerabilities like password reuse and enhances security against brute-force attacks by ensuring each hashed password is unique, even if users have identical passwords.
                         
   ##### Hashing Passwords: 
                        hashSync, hash
   ##### Comparing Passwords:
   compareSync, compare
   ##### Getting Rounds: 
   getRounds


  2) cookie-parser :- cookie-parser is a convenient middleware for handling cookies in Express applications. It simplifies the process of parsing cookies from incoming requests and setting cookies in responses. By using cookie-parser, you can easily manage cookies, enhancing the functionality and security of your web applications.

  #### Initialization: cookieParser(secret, options)
  #### Reading Cookies: req.cookies, req.signedCookies
  #### Setting Cookies: res.cookie(name, value, options)
  #### Clearing Cookies: res.clearCookie(name, options)

  3) cors :- lets your website ask for data from other websites safely.You want your frontend website to get data from your backend server. To make this work safely, you need to set up CORS on your backend server.
  
  Ex :- Your frontend website at http://frontend.com
        Your backend server at http://api.com

   #### Important CORS Methods
    1) Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies which origins can access the resource.
    2) Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Defines which HTTP methods are permitted when accessing the resource.
    3) Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Lists the HTTP headers that can be used during the actual request.
    4) Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: Indicates if credentials like cookies can be sent with the request.
    5) Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Specifies which headers can be exposed to the client.
    6) Access-Control-Max-Age: Sets the duration for which the results of a preflight request can be cached by the browser.

  4) dotenv :- dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env, which helps manage configuration variables in a simple and secure way.
    
   #### Security: -
                  Keeps sensitive data like API keys and database credentials out of your source code.
   #### Convenience:-
                Simplifies configuration management across different environments (development, testing, production).

  5) express :- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications, handling routes, managing middleware, and interacting with databases.

   #### Key Features of Express
   1) Routing:- Defines URL endpoints (routes) to handle HTTP requests.
   2) Middleware:- Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
   3) Template Engines:- Supports various template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars.
   4) Static Files:- Serves static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   5) Error Handling:- Provides a mechanism for handling errors.

  
  6) jsonwebtoken :- JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. JWTs are often used for authentication and information exchange in web applications, allowing servers to verify the authenticity of requests and securely transmit data without needing to store session state on the server. They are signed using a secret key or a public/private key pair, ensuring that the information is trusted and not tampered with.

  7) mongodb :- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is known for its scalability, performance, and ease of use.
  
  8) mongoose :- Mongoose is a Node.js library that provides a schema-based solution to model application data and interact with MongoDB databases efficiently.

   #### key features 

    1) Schema Definition: Define MongoDB document structure and data types.
    2) Validation: Ensure data meets specific requirements before saving.
    3) Query Building: Fluent API for building MongoDB queries.
    4) Middleware: Execute logic before or after database operations.
    5) Population: Reference and populate data across different collections.
    6) Virtual: Define computed properties not stored in the database.
    7) Plugins: Extend functionality with reusable schema, methods, and middleware.

    
   
 9) nodemon :-  this use to automatically update node server when any changes is done we don't need to start      server manually again and again soo rather than node app.js we use // nodemon app.js
                     to use nodemon add this inside script :- "start": "nodemon app.js"
